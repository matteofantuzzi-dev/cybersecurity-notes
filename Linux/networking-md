# Linux Networking

## Cos'è
Linux provides tools to monitor and manage network interfaces, connections, and routes.

## Perché è importante
Networking knowledge is essential for troubleshooting, scanning, penetration testing, and incident response in cybersecurity.

## Basic Networking Commands

### ifconfig (deprecated)
- Shows network interfaces and their configuration
- Still found on older systems

### ip addr
- Displays IP addresses and interface details
- Modern replacement for ifconfig

### ping
- Tests connectivity between hosts using ICMP
- Useful to check if a host is reachable

### traceroute
- Shows the path packets take to reach a destination
- Helps identify network routing issues

### netstat (legacy)
- Displays network connections and listening ports
- Largely replaced by `ss` on modern systems

---

## ss (Socket Statistics)

`ss` is a modern replacement for `netstat` used to inspect network sockets.
It communicates directly with the Linux kernel, making it faster and more accurate.

### Common options
- `ss -l` : show listening sockets
- `ss -t` : show TCP connections
- `ss -u` : show UDP connections
- `ss -n` : show numeric IPs and ports
- `ss -p` : show the process using the socket
- `ss -tuln` : list all listening TCP and UDP ports
- `ss -s` : display socket statistics

### Security relevance
- Identify exposed services
- Detect unexpected open ports
- Useful during incident response and system auditing

### Common Errors
- Forgetting `-n`, causing slow DNS resolution
- Not using `-p`, missing the process behind a connection

## Common Errors (General Networking)
- Forgetting to check network interfaces before scanning
- Using ping or traceroute without proper permissions
- Overlooking firewall or routing issues
