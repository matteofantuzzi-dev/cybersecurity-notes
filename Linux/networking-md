# Linux Networking

## Cos'è
Linux provides tools to monitor and manage network interfaces, connections, and routes.

## Perché è importante
Networking knowledge is essential for troubleshooting, scanning, and penetration testing.

## Comandi principali
```bash
ifconfig           # Show network interfaces (deprecated, but still used)
ip addr            # Show IP addresses
ping <host>        # Test connectivity
traceroute <host>  # Trace route to a host
netstat -tuln      # Show listening ports

## Errori comuni
- Forgetting to check network interfaces before scanning
- Using ping/traceroute without proper permissions
- Overlooking firewall or routing issues
