# Linux Filesystem

## Cos'è
The Linux filesystem organizes files and directories hierarchically starting from the root (/). Each file has permissions, ownership, and a type.

## Perché è importante
Understanding the filesystem is crucial for navigation, file management, and security.

## Comandi principali
```bash
pwd         # Show current directory
ls -la      # List files with details
cd <dir>    # Change directory
mount       # Mount a filesystem
df -h       # Show disk usage

## Errori comuni
- Confusing relative and absolute paths
- Modifying system files without proper permissions
- Forgetting to check mounted drives before operations
