## Overview
This document contains notes from Windows Fundamentals 1 (TryHackMe).
It focuses on the Windows operating system, its interface, user management,
and basic security-related components.

## Windows Interface
- Desktop, Start Menu, Taskbar, and Notification Area
- Control Panel and Settings
- Task Manager for monitoring processes and performance
- Keyboard shortcut to open Task Manager: Ctrl + Shift + Esc

---

## User Accounts
- Windows uses different account types (Administrator, Standard, Guest)
- Built-in Guest account provides limited access
- User accounts can belong to multiple groups
- Groups define permissions and system access

## User Groups
Common Windows groups include:
- Users
- Remote Desktop Users
- Administrators
- Guests

Group membership determines what actions a user can perform on the system.

---

## System Management Tools
- Control Panel (Small icons view for full list)
- Task Manager (processes, performance, services)
- Local Users and Groups (lusrmgr.msc)
- Services and startup programs

## Security Concepts
- Principle of least privilege
- Importance of user and group separation
- Built-in security features such as Windows Defender Firewall

## Common Errors
- Confusing user accounts with groups
- Running daily tasks with administrator privileges
- Ignoring group permissions
- Not monitoring running processes
